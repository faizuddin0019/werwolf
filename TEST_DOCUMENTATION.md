# Test Documentation - Real-time Synchronization

This document describes the comprehensive test suite for the Werwolf game's real-time synchronization features.

## Overview

The test suite addresses all critical issues that were fixed today:

1. **Player Join Visibility** - Real-time updates without refresh
2. **Werwolf Turn Progression** - Automatic phase advancement
3. **Police Inspect Response** - Yes/no based on actual detection
4. **Host Role Actions Visibility** - Real-time round state updates
5. **Real-time Synchronization** - Multiple clients consistency
6. **Edge Cases and Error Handling** - Robust error handling

## Test Files

### `test-realtime-sync.js`
Main test file containing all test cases for real-time synchronization.

### `run-realtime-tests.sh`
Shell script to run the tests with proper environment setup.

## Test Cases

### Test 1: Player Join Visibility
**Purpose**: Verify that host and players can see who joins without page refresh.

**Steps**:
1. Create a game with a host
2. Add 6 players sequentially
3. Verify each player is visible to all participants
4. Check that player count updates in real-time

**Expected Results**:
- All 7 players (1 host + 6 players) are visible
- No page refresh required
- Real-time updates work correctly

### Test 2: Werwolf Turn Progression
**Purpose**: Verify that game phases advance automatically after player actions.

**Steps**:
1. Start the game (assign roles)
2. Verify game is in `night_wolf` phase
3. Werewolf selects a target
4. Verify phase automatically advances to `night_police`
5. Police inspects a target
6. Verify phase automatically advances to `night_doctor`
7. Doctor saves a target
8. Verify phase automatically advances to `reveal`

**Expected Results**:
- Game starts in `night_wolf` phase
- Each action automatically advances to the next phase
- No manual host intervention required

### Test 3: Police Inspect Response
**Purpose**: Verify that police get correct yes/no responses based on actual role detection.

**Steps**:
1. Find police, werewolf, and villager players
2. Police inspects werewolf ‚Üí should return `'werewolf'`
3. Police inspects villager ‚Üí should return `'not_werewolf'`
4. Police inspects doctor ‚Üí should return `'not_werewolf'`

**Expected Results**:
- Police correctly detects werewolf as `'werewolf'`
- Police correctly detects non-werewolves as `'not_werewolf'`
- Results are based on actual database role data

### Test 4: Host Role Actions Visibility
**Purpose**: Verify that host can see all role actions and results in real-time.

**Steps**:
1. Reset game to `night_wolf` phase
2. Werewolf selects target ‚Üí verify round state update
3. Police inspects target ‚Üí verify round state update with result
4. Doctor saves target ‚Üí verify round state update
5. Verify all actions are visible in round state

**Expected Results**:
- Host can see werewolf target selection
- Host can see police inspection results with werewolf/not werewolf tags
- Host can see doctor save actions
- All updates happen without page refresh

### Test 5: Real-time Synchronization
**Purpose**: Verify that multiple clients see consistent game state.

**Steps**:
1. Create a new game with multiple players
2. Start the game
3. Simulate multiple clients fetching game state
4. Verify all clients see the same game state
5. Perform a role action
6. Verify all clients see the update in real-time

**Expected Results**:
- All clients see consistent game state
- Phase changes are synchronized across all clients
- Real-time updates work for multiple clients

### Test 6: Edge Cases and Error Handling
**Purpose**: Verify robust error handling for edge cases.

**Steps**:
1. Test invalid game code ‚Üí should return error
2. Test invalid client ID ‚Üí should return error
3. Test duplicate player join ‚Üí should return error
4. Test action without proper role ‚Üí should return error

**Expected Results**:
- All edge cases are handled gracefully
- Appropriate error messages are returned
- System remains stable

## Running Tests

### Local Development
```bash
# Run against local development server
npm run test:realtime:local

# Or directly
TEST_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000 node test-realtime-sync.js
```

### Production
```bash
# Run against production server
npm run test:realtime:prod

# Or directly
TEST_BASE_URL=https://wearwolf-theta.vercel.app node test-realtime-sync.js
```

### All Tests
```bash
# Run all test suites
npm run test:all
```

### Shell Script
```bash
# Make executable and run
chmod +x run-realtime-tests.sh
./run-realtime-tests.sh
```

## Test Configuration

### Environment Variables
- `TEST_BASE_URL`: Base URL for the application (default: `http://localhost:3000`)

### Test Data
- Each test generates unique client IDs using timestamps and random strings
- Test games are automatically cleaned up after completion
- Tests use realistic player names and scenarios

## Expected Output

### Successful Test Run

### Failed Test Run
```
‚ùå Test 2 failed: Expected phase 'night_police', got 'night_wolf'
‚ö†Ô∏è Some tests failed. Please check the issues above.
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Connection Refused**
   - Ensure the application is running
   - Check the TEST_BASE_URL is correct
   - Verify the port is accessible

2. **Test Timeouts**
   - Increase sleep delays in tests
   - Check network connectivity
   - Verify Supabase connection

3. **Database Errors**
   - Ensure Supabase is properly configured
   - Check environment variables
   - Verify database schema is up to date

4. **Real-time Sync Issues**
   - Check Supabase real-time configuration
   - Verify WebSocket connections
   - Check browser console for errors

### Debug Mode
Add debug logging by modifying the test file:
```javascript
// Add at the top of test functions
console.log('üîç Debug: Current game state:', gameResponse.data)
```

## Integration with CI/CD

The tests can be integrated into CI/CD pipelines:

```yaml
# Example GitHub Actions workflow
- name: Run Real-time Tests
  run: |
    npm run test:realtime:prod
  env:
    TEST_BASE_URL: ${{ secrets.TEST_BASE_URL }}
```

## Maintenance

### Adding New Tests
1. Add new test function to `test-realtime-sync.js`
2. Add test to the `tests` array in `runAllTests()`
3. Update this documentation
4. Test the new test case

### Updating Existing Tests
1. Modify the test function
2. Update expected results in documentation
3. Verify test still passes
4. Update any related documentation

## Performance Considerations

- Tests include appropriate delays for real-time synchronization
- Each test cleans up after itself
- Tests can be run in parallel (with different game codes)
- Consider rate limiting for production testing

## Security Considerations

- Tests use test-specific client IDs
- No sensitive data is logged
- Tests clean up after completion
- Production tests should use test accounts only
