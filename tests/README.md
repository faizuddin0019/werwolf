## 🧪 Test Categories

### Core Game Logic Tests (`core/`)
Tests the fundamental game functionality:
- ✅ Game creation and setup
- ✅ Player joining and management
- ✅ Role assignment (werewolf, doctor, police, villagers)
- ✅ Win conditions and game ending logic
- ✅ Basic game flow validation

### Integration Tests (`integration/`)
Tests real-time synchronization and complex interactions:
- ✅ Real-time events for host visibility
- ✅ Host voting exclusion
- ✅ Player management (removal, leave requests)
- ✅ Leave request system (request, approve, deny)
- ✅ Host redirect prevention
- ✅ Game state synchronization

### Performance Tests (`performance/`)
Tests optimization and efficiency:
- ✅ Debounced updates to prevent excessive API calls
- ✅ Console logging optimization (development vs production)
- ✅ Real-time sync efficiency
- ✅ Memory usage optimization
- ✅ Network request efficiency

## 🚀 Running Tests

### Using npm scripts (recommended):

```bash
# Run all tests locally
npm run test:all

# Run specific test categories
npm run test:core              # Core game logic
npm run test:integration       # Real-time sync integration
npm run test:performance       # Battery optimization

# Run tests against production
npm run test:all:prod
npm run test:core:prod
npm run test:integration:prod
npm run test:performance:prod

# CI/CD integration
npm run test:ci               # Run all tests for CI
npm run test:verify           # Quick verification test
```

### Using shell scripts:

```bash
# Run all tests
./tests/run-tests.sh

# Run specific categories
./tests/run-tests.sh http://localhost:3000 core
./tests/run-tests.sh http://localhost:3000 integration
./tests/run-tests.sh http://localhost:3000 performance

# Run against production
./tests/run-tests.sh https://wearwolf-theta.vercel.app all
```

### Direct execution:

```bash
# Run individual test files
TEST_URL=http://localhost:3000 node tests/core/game-logic.test.js
TEST_URL=http://localhost:3000 node tests/integration/real-time-sync.test.js
TEST_URL=http://localhost:3000 node tests/performance/battery-optimization.test.js

# Run master test runner
TEST_URL=http://localhost:3000 node tests/run-all-tests.js
```

## 📊 Test Results

Each test suite provides detailed results including:
- ✅ Pass/fail status for each test
- 📝 Detailed error messages for failures
- ⏱️ Execution time and performance metrics
- 📈 Summary statistics

## 🔧 Configuration

### Environment Variables:
- `TEST_URL`: Base URL for the application (default: http://localhost:3000)
- `NODE_ENV`: Environment mode (affects console logging tests)

### Test Configuration:
- **Timeout**: 30 seconds per test suite
- **Retries**: 3 attempts for failed tests
- **Concurrent**: Tests run sequentially to avoid conflicts

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **Server not running**:
   ```
   ❌ Server is not running at http://localhost:3000
   ```
   **Solution**: Start the development server with `npm run dev`

2. **Test timeouts**:
   ```
   ❌ Test timed out after 30 seconds
   ```
   **Solution**: Check server performance and network connectivity

3. **Database connection issues**:
   ```
   ❌ Failed to fetch game data
   ```
   **Solution**: Verify Supabase configuration and database connectivity

### Debug Mode:
Set `NODE_ENV=development` to enable detailed logging:
```bash
NODE_ENV=development npm run test:all
```

## 📝 Adding New Tests

### To add a new test category:
1. Create a new directory under `tests/`
2. Add your test file following the naming convention `*.test.js`
3. Implement the test class with `runAllTests()` method
4. Update `run-all-tests.js` to include your new test suite
5. Add npm scripts to `package.json`

### To add tests to existing categories:
1. Add new test methods to the existing test class
2. Call them from the `runAllTests()` method
3. Follow the existing pattern for error handling and reporting
