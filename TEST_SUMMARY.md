# Test Suite Summary - Werwolf Game

## ðŸŽ¯ Overview

This document provides a comprehensive summary of the test infrastructure implemented for the Werwolf game, covering all critical game logic fixes and automated testing capabilities.

## ðŸ§ª Test Infrastructure Implemented

### 1. **End Game Logic Tests** (`test-end-game-logic.js`)
**Comprehensive test suite for critical game logic fixes:**

#### Test Scenarios:
- **End Game Logic with Two Players**: Verifies winner declaration when only 2 non-host players remain
- **Host Exclusion from Win Conditions**: Ensures host doesn't affect win calculations
- **Winner Declaration Closeable**: Tests closeable winner screen functionality
- **Real-time Sync and Frame Refresh**: Verifies immediate UI updates on all events

#### Key Assertions:
- Game ends when only 2 non-host players remain
- Winner declared based on werewolf status (not host)
- Host excluded from win condition calculations
- Real-time updates work correctly

### 2. **Demo Test Runner** (`test-demo.js`)
**Simulates test scenarios without requiring Supabase credentials:**
- Demonstrates test infrastructure
- Shows test flow and assertions
- Provides setup instructions
- No environment setup required

### 3. **Test Runner** (`run-all-tests.sh`)
**Automated test execution with:**
- Server availability checking
- Environment detection (local/staging/production)
- Comprehensive test reporting
- Automatic cleanup and error handling

### 4. **Test Configuration** (`test-config.js`)
**Centralized configuration:**
- Environment settings
- Test data and scenarios
- Assertion helpers
- Utility functions

### 5. **Documentation** (`TESTING.md`)
**Complete testing guide:**
- Test structure and scenarios
- Running instructions
- Troubleshooting guide
- Contributing guidelines

## ðŸ”§ Package.json Scripts

### Available Commands:
```bash
# Demo (No setup required)
npm run test:demo

# Local testing (Requires Supabase setup)
npm run test:end-game

# Production testing (Requires Supabase setup)
npm run test:end-game:prod

# Comprehensive test suite
npm run test:all-new

# Build and test verification
npm run test:build
```

## ðŸŽ® Test Coverage

### âœ… **End Game Logic:**
- Game ends when only 2 non-host players remain
- Winner declared based on werewolf status
- Host excluded from win calculations
- Proper game phase transitions

### âœ… **Winner Declaration:**
- Winner screen appears correctly
- Host can close winner declaration
- Game can be ended after winner declared
- UI updates in real-time

### âœ… **Real-time Sync:**
- Game state updates immediately
- Vote counts sync across players
- Phase changes reflected instantly
- Frame refresh on all events

### âœ… **Host Exclusion:**
- Host not counted in win conditions
- Host excluded from survivors list
- Proper player counting logic
- Game flow unaffected by host

## ðŸš€ Automated Testing

### **Pre-commit Hooks:**
- ESLint checking
- TypeScript type checking
- End game logic tests
- Quality gates prevent broken code

### **CI/CD Ready:**
- GitHub Actions workflow (requires workflow scope)
- Automated testing on push/PR
- Production deployment tests
- Build verification

## ðŸ“Š Test Results

## ðŸ”§ Setup Instructions

### **For Demo Testing (No Setup Required):**
```bash
npm run test:demo
```

### **For Actual Testing (Requires Supabase Setup):**
```bash
# 1. Set environment variables
export NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL="https://your-project.supabase.co"
export NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY="your-anon-key"

# 2. Run tests
npm run test:end-game        # Local tests
npm run test:end-game:prod   # Production tests
npm run test:all-new         # Comprehensive suite
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Critical Game Logic Tested

### **1. End Game Logic Fix:**
- **Problem**: When only 2 players left, voting didn't make sense
- **Solution**: Game ends and declares winner based on werewolf status
- **Test**: Verifies correct winner declaration when 2 players remain

### **2. Host Exclusion Fix:**
- **Problem**: Host was counted in win conditions
- **Solution**: Host excluded from win condition calculations
- **Test**: Verifies host doesn't affect win state

### **3. Winner Declaration Fix:**
- **Problem**: Host couldn't easily end game after winner declared
- **Solution**: Closeable winner declaration screen
- **Test**: Verifies host can close winner screen

### **4. Frame Refresh Fix:**
- **Problem**: Frames not refreshing upon events
- **Solution**: Enhanced real-time sync with immediate updates
- **Test**: Verifies all events trigger immediate UI updates

## ðŸ“ˆ Benefits

### **Quality Assurance:**
- Comprehensive test coverage for critical game logic
- Automated testing prevents regressions
- Quality gates ensure code standards

### **Development Efficiency:**
