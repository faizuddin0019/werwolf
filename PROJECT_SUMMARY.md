## 🎮 How It Works

### For Hosts
1. **Start Game**: Enter host name, get 6-digit code
2. **Share Code**: Players join using the code
3. **Assign Roles**: Click "Assign Roles & Start" when ready
4. **Control Flow**: Use host controls to manage game phases
5. **Reveal Results**: Show deaths, saves, investigations
6. **Manage Voting**: Start voting, call final vote, eliminate players
7. **End Game**: Use "End Game" button to terminate game at any time
8. **Leave Game**: Host can leave (ends game) or players can leave (with approval)

### For Players
1. **Join Game**: Enter 6-digit code and player name
2. **Wait in Lobby**: Wait for host to assign roles
3. **Follow Instructions**: Click buttons when it's your turn
4. **Vote**: Select players to eliminate during day
5. **Leave Game**: Use "Leave Game" button (context-aware messaging)
6. **State Persistence**: Game state saved across page refreshes
7. **Win**: Help your team achieve victory!

### Game Flow
1. **Lobby** → Players join, host assigns roles
2. **Night** → Werewolves select victim, Doctor saves, Police inspects
3. **Reveal** → Show who died (if not saved)
4. **Day** → All players vote to eliminate suspect
5. **Repeat** → Continue until win condition
6. **Leave Game** → Players can leave (auto-end if < 6 players)
7. **End Game** → Host can end game, complete data cleanup
