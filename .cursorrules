# Brevity & Output Budget (project rule)

## Global style
- Default to *brief mode*. No preambles, apologies, or restatements.
- Explanations: ≤ 80 words unless explicitly asked "explain".
- Lists: max 5 bullets, 1 line each.
- Code: prefer **diffs** or **single functions** over full files unless asked "full file".

## Hard caps
- Max output ≈ 500 tokens (~350–400 words).
- If an answer would exceed the cap: return the **shortest useful answer** plus one line: "More? say 'expand <section>'".
- Never include internal reasoning. Only final answers.

## Formats
- For code edits: return **unified diff** or minimal patch.
- For diagnostics: 3 bullets: (1) root cause (2) fix (3) risk.

## Refuse patterns
- No repeated summaries of user context.
- No "here’s what you asked" mirrors.
- No multi-paragraph prose unless "long-form" was requested.

## Checks (before sending)
- If > 500 tokens predicted or > 60 lines: trim examples, prefer references, collapse prose to bullets.
